# Node-MCU-Sensor-Network-
Having multiple sensors at a place is quite common these days. So why not create a sensor network that sends all the data to a Master and also an android app? This project focuses on the concept of creating a sensor network with multiple slaves and a master.

# How does it work?
I am using thingspeak as a server now.This helps the user to retrieve the data remotely. We can configure it be displayed on a OLED. The data from the slaves or clients can also be accessed through a mobile app provided if it is connected in the same netwrok.
